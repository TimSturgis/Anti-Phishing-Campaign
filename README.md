<h1>Anti-Phishing Campaign | Awareness & Prevention </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this Cybersecurity Analyst job simulation from Mastercard, I identified phishing emails, created example phishing emails, and finally, created a short PowerPoint presentation to train employees of the danger of phishing and what they can do to protect against it.

This is an example of a phishing email that was sent to an employee. Some telltale signs that this is most likely a phishing email are the suspicious source email address, poor spelling, hyperlinks and sense of urgency. <br/>

Lastly I created a short PowerPoint presentation to train employees of the danger of phishing and what they can do to protect against it. This demonstrates what could be sent out as a ppt to all employees as part of an anti-phishing campaign in a workplace environment.  <br/> Slide 1:
